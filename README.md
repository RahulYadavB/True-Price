# Price Estimator Tool

## Objective
This tool estimates the fair price of a product and calculates an optimal boost price for listing the product on marketplaces like Facebook. The tool helps users make informed decisions on how much to boost their listings for better visibility.

## Features
- **Price Estimation**: Estimate the fair price of a product based on its category, condition, and other details.
- **Boost Price Calculation**: Calculate an optimal boost price based on a percentage of the estimated price.
- **Product Listing Analysis** (Optional): Provide feedback on listed price adjustments based on market trends.
