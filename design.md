# Price Estimator Tool Design Plan

## MODULE 1: INPUT COLLECTION
- Accept user inputs:
    - Product Category
    - Product Condition
    - Original Price
    - Product Age (in years/months)
    - Optional: Listing URL

## MODULE 2: DATA VALIDATION
- Validate inputs:
    - Ensure no field is empty.
    - Check Original Price is a valid number.
    - Ensure Age is within realistic bounds (e.g., > 0).
    - Validate URL format if provided.

## MODULE 3: MARKET DATA RETRIEVAL
- IF Category provided:
    - Fetch market data for similar products from:
        - Facebook Marketplace
        - eBay
        - OLX
    - Extract data points:
        - Product name
        - Condition
        - Average price
        - Supply-demand trends

## MODULE 4: FAIR PRICE CALCULATION
- Calculate Depreciation Rate based on:
    - Product Category (e.g., Electronics = 20%, Furniture = 10% per year).
- Apply formula:
    Fair Price = Original Price × (1 - Depreciation Rate × Age) × Market Adjustment Factor
- Validate Fair Price:
    - Ensure it’s within realistic market bounds (e.g., not negative).

## MODULE 5: BOOST PRICE CALCULATION
- Define Boost Percentage based on:
    - Product Category
    - Demand trends
- Apply formula:
    Boost Price = Fair Price × Boost Percentage

## MODULE 6: LISTING URL ANALYSIS (Optional)
- IF URL provided:
    - Extract:
        - Product Category
        - Listing Price
    - Compare Listing Price to Fair Price:
        Difference = (Listing Price - Fair Price) / Fair Price × 100
    - IF Difference > Threshold (e.g., 20%):
        - Apply penalty multiplier to Boost Price:
            Adjusted Boost Price = Boost Price × Penalty Multiplier
    - ELSE:
        - Recommend Boost Price as is.

## MODULE 7: OUTPUT RESULTS
- Display results to the user:
    - Fair Price
    - Recommended Boost Price
    - Optional Feedback:
        - "Listing Price is higher than the estimated fair price. Adjust accordingly."

## MODULE 8: FUTURE INTEGRATION (Optional)
- Plan for:
    - Automated market data retrieval via APIs.
    - Enhanced UI for dynamic user interactions.
    - Integration with payment systems for boosting services.
